          This course will show beyond a doubt that the 21st century is the most
          unique to date for humans and explain why navigating its man-made
          challenges will define humanity&apos;s progress. It will challenge you
          to{" "}
          <Mark>
            rethink contemporary definitions and the mainstream understanding of
            capitalism
          </Mark>{" "}
          and demonstrate why an overhaul is long overdue.

        <p>
          <i>Why the 21st Century Will Surprise Us</i> offers a fresh
          perspective on the need to reshape capitalism; from a system that
          prioritises perpetual growth at all costs, to one that maximises
          collective well-being and contributes to common prosperity in a
          resource constrained world.

          This course offers an honest understanding of the world we live in,
          including the existential threats facing humanity and the societal
          traumas we have inadvertently created. It provides a deep appreciation
          of the challenges presented by modern civilisation and the immense
          possibilities for change when we recognise and accept the root causes
          of the crises we face.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are the greatest challenges of our times and how do we confront
          them head-on? How can societies be redesigned to overcome these
          challenges and thrive? How can each of us find purpose in the
          different spheres of our life and contribute to redesigning society?
