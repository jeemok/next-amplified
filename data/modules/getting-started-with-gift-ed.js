              Gain a critical understanding of the greatest
              challenges of our time, how we must redesign society
              to overcome them and thrive, and find out how can
              each of us find purpose in the different spheres of
              our life and contribute to redesigning society.

            <p>
              This course offers an honest understanding of the
              world we live in, including the existential threats
              facing humanity and the societal traumas we have
              inadvertently created. It provides a deep
              appreciation of the challenges presented by modern
              civilisation and the immense possibilities for
              change when we recognise and accept the root causes
              of the crises we face.
            </p>
            <p>
              What are the greatest challenges of our times and
              how do we confront them head-on? How can societies
              be redesigned to overcome these challenges and
              thrive? How can each of us find purpose in the
              different spheres of our life and contribute to
              redesigning society?
